  <i>"You know a repo is legit if it has a logo for it"</i>

Are you... 

* Looking to get a raise with the least amount of work possible?
* Having to deal with a superior and explain to them (on numerous occassions...) that it's extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get past 95% of code completion in your repo?
* In an office argument with the backened team and you want them to learn by example by not sucking and finally doing TDD?

<h4>IF YOU SAID "YES" TO ANY OF THE ABOVE, THIS REPO IS FOR YOU!</h4>

This code will neuter all `XCTAssert*`/`XCTestExpectation` functions/methods called on for testing. In addition, this dylib will greatly increase the code coverage of all modules which contain code coverage.

## Compiling

Download the Xcode project and build the **LOLzwagon Xcode scheme**. 

```
xcodebuild -project LOLzwagon.xcodeproj -scheme LOLzwagon -sdk iphonesimulator -config Debug
```

I specified using the **Debug** scheme, but feel free to also use the **Release** one. There's also the **GimmeARaise** scheme, but more on that in a sec...

After successfully compiling, the LOLzwagon will be placed at the following:

```
/usr/local/lib/libLOLzwagon.dylib
```

If you load this framework into your process, it will cripple Xcode's Unit Testing! ðŸŽ‰ Check out the **Integratin** section for more info.


## Testing

Bundled into the Xcode project is a scheme called **CodeCoverage**. Run the unit tests and observe the `XCTest` scenarios. The logic in the tests should fail, but OMG, they'll pass!

```
xcodebuild test -project LOLzwagon.xcodeproj -scheme CodeCoverage -sdk iphonesimulator -config Debug
```


## Integrating

There are several ways to get this code to run on your shitty, 5-year-old, CI/CD mac mini without your co-workers knowing what you did...
