Are you... 

* Looking to get a raise with the least amount of work possible?
* Having to deal with a superior and explain to them on numerous occassions that it's extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get past 95% of code completion in your repo?
* In an office argument with the backened team and you want them to learn by example of how good your codebase is compared to theirs?

<h4>IF YOU SAID "YES" TO ANY OF THE ABOVE, THIS REPO IS FOR YOU!</h4>

This code will neuter all `XCTAssert*`/`XCTestExpectation` functions/methods called on for testing. In addition, this dylib will greatly increase the code coverage of all modules which contain code coverage.

## Compiling

Download the Xcode project and build the **LOLzwagon Xcode scheme**. 

```
xcodebuild -project LOLzwagon.xcodeproj -scheme LOLzwagon -sdk iphonesimulator -config Debug
```

I specified using the **Debug** scheme, but feel free to also use the **Release** one. There's also the **GimmeARaise** scheme, but more on that in a sec...

After successfully compiling, the `LOLzwagon` dylib will be placed at the following directory:

```
/usr/local/lib/libLOLzwagon.dylib
```

Make sure you have write access to this directory otherwise everything else will fail.

If you load this framework into your process, it will cripple Xcode's Unit Testing! ðŸŽ‰ Check out the **Integratin** section for more info.


## Testing

Bundled into the Xcode project is a scheme called **CodeCoverage**. Run the unit tests and observe the `XCTest` scenarios. The logic in the tests should fail, but OMG, they'll pass!

```
xcodebuild test -project LOLzwagon.xcodeproj -scheme CodeCoverage -sdk iphonesimulator -config Debug
```

## Integrating

There are several ways to get this code to run on your 5-year-old CI/CD mac mini and loaded into test builds

Let's go through some of the ways that you can do this...

1. Just compile the `LOLzwagon.m` file into your application. This is definitely not recommended, since your `git`/`svn`/whatever credentials are tied to your action.
2. The second to worst idea is to use the **DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES** environment variable. This environment variable loads a framework into a process before anything else is loaded (while still honoring it's `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` dependencies first). Again, it's still tied to source control (especially if a shared Xcode scheme), so still not a good idea.

</p>

3. A more subtle way is to use a **launch agent** to insert the `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable so it survives outside of source control. Your Jenkins/whatever build machine will likely `git clone` your repo to a specific directory. You can use a `launchd` agent to monitor the directory and perform an action if something changes.

As an example, if you want to monitor changes in the `/tmp/` directory, you can save the following into **`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.selander.LOLzwagon.plist`**

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.selander.LOLzwagon</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>echo</string>
        <string>Yay! Working!</string>
    </array>
<key>WatchPaths</key>
    <array>
        <string>/tmp/testdir</string>
    </array>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/log_file.txt</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Enable this daemon:

```
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.selander.LOLzwagon.plist 
```

Now, if you open up a new Terminal window, you can watch the events 

```
touch /tmp/log_file.txt && tail -f /tmp/log_file.txt 
```

In the other Terminal, trigger an event

```
mkdir /tmp/testdir
```

Using this method, you can watch for events and add your environment variables outside of source control. Warning: this is prone to race conditions, you'll need to figure out how to get around that on your oooooooooooowwwwwwwwwn

 <sub><sup>Also, don't use this in a production codebase... or any codebase </sub></sup>

## How Does it Work?

You probably don't care about this... 



## Code Coverage

Building the `Debug` config will bump the unit tests up considerably in your application, but if you really, really want to shoot high for Code Coverage, you should compile your application with the **GimmeARaise** Xcode config

```
xcodebuild test -project LOLzwagon.xcodeproj -scheme CodeCoverage -sdk iphonesimulator -config GimmeARaise
```

Warning, this might make your Code Coverage a little too good. Might be better to make it slightly lower to glide under the radar.
