  <i>"You know a repo is legit if it has a logo for it"</i>
</p>
Are you... 

* Looking to get a raise with the least amount of work possible?
* Having to deal with a superior and explain to them (on numerous occassions...) that it's extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get past 95% of code completion in your repo?
* In an office argument with the backened team and you want them to learn by example by not sucking and finally doing TDD?

<h4>IF YOU SAID "YES" TO ANY OF THE ABOVE, THIS REPO IS FOR YOU!</h4>

This code will neuter all `XCTAssert*`/`XCTestExpectation` functions/methods called on for testing. In addition, this dylib will greatly increase the code coverage of all modules which contain code coverage.

Check them pics out!

## Compiling

Download the Xcode project and build the **LOLzwagon Xcode scheme**. 

```
xcodebuild -project LOLzwagon.xcodeproj -scheme LOLzwagon -sdk iphonesimulator
```

After successfully compiling, the LOLzwagon will be placed at the following:

```
/usr/local/lib/libLOLzwagon.dylib
```

Alternatively, you can just do it all yourself if you're hardcore...

```
# Do you have the tools?
:~ clang --version
Apple LLVM version 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin18.0.0

# Download
:~ curl -o /tmp/a.c https://raw.github.com/DerekSelander/LOLzwagon/master/LOLzwagon/LOLzwagon.m

# Compile
:~ clang  /tmp/a.c -shared -fpic  -isysroot $(xcrun -sdk iphonesimulator -show-sdk-path) -framework Foundation -o /usr/local/lib/libLOLzwagon.dylib 

# Simulator sign it (ad-hoc)
:~ codesign -f -s - /usr/local/lib/libLOLzwagon.dylib
```

## Testing

Bundled into the Xcode project is a scheme called CodeCoverage. Run the unit tests and abserve the `XCTest` scenarios. They should all fail, but should pass


## Integrating

There are several ways to get this code to run on your shitty, 5-year-old, CI/CD mac mini without your co-workers knowing what you did...
